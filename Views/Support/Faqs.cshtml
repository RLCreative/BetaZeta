                <h3>1. Which refills do I need for my pail?</h3>
                <p>
                    To purchase the correct size refill you first need to know which size pail you have.
                    There are three sizes: <strong>Classic, Plus, </strong>and<strong> XL</strong>.
                    To determine which size D&eacute;kor you have, check the label affixed to the inside
                    of your pail's front service door. After you determine what size pail you have,
                    purchase the corresponding refill for your pail. <a href="/pailandrefillsizes.aspx"
                        target="_self">Go here for more.</a>
                </p>
                <h3>2. I have an previous model of the D&eacute;kor pail. Will the refills still work?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, each refill size is backwards compatible with the previous pail of that size.
                    In other words, all Plus size refills will work with ALL Plus sized pails, etc.
                </p>
                <h3>3. My D&eacute;kor is broken or does not work properly. </h3>
                <p>
                    Some parts on the D&eacute;kor are replaceable, such as the trap doors. Please contact
                    <a href="/customercare/default.aspx">Customer Care</a>and tell us more about the
                    problem you are having.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Is my product covered under warranty?</h3>
                <p>
                    All D&eacute;kor pails are covered by a six month limited warranty covering manufacture
                    defects. If your product suffers from a defect covered under warranty contact us
                    for repair or replacement. Warranties are valid from original date of purchase,
                    non-transferrable, and covers the product under normal use and conditions. Misuse
                    and normal wear and tear is not covered. Products purchased from non-authorized
                    dealers, such as e-Bay&reg;, are not covered under warranty.
                </p>
                <h3>5. How do I change the refill on my D&eacute;kor? </h3>
                <p>
                    It's easy to install a new refill. <a href="/customercare/default.aspx#refill" target="_self">
                        Click here </a>for more information on replacing a refill.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Can I use D&eacute;kor with cloth diapers?</h4>
                <p>
                    D&eacute;kor will work perfectly fine as a hamper for your cloth diapers. Simply
                    cut the bag and take them to the laundry room.
                </p>
                <h3>7. How many diapers will my pail actually hold?</h3>
                <p>
                    Typically, the D&eacute;kor Classic will hold up to <strong>40</strong>newborn diapers,
                    while the D&eacute;kor Plus will hold up to <strong>60</strong>newborn diapers before
                    it is full and needs to be emptied. The number on the outside of the refill boxes
                    refers to the total number of diapers that can be used with <strong>both</strong>
                    refills. The number is based on newborn diapers and will vary for each person.
                </p>
                <h3>8. Do I have to wait until my pail is full to empty?</h3>
                <p>
                    You may choose to empty your pail as often as needed to suite your needs, after
                    each change or when the pail is filled to capacity. Of course, emptying more often
                    will decrease the potential for odor to build up in your pail.
                </p>
                <h3>9. What should I use to clean my D&eacute;kor? </h3>
                <p>
                    Frequently wipe down the Diaper D&eacute;kor with a non-abrasive household cleaner.
                    You may also clean the pail with bleach to disinfect as it will not harm the ABS
                    plastic.
                </p>
                <h3>10. How do I convert the D&eacute;kor from a diaper disposal system to a trash can?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You simply remove the "diaper insert". <a href="/customercare/default.aspx" target="_self">

                </p>
                <h3>11. What makes D&eacute;kor better than other diaper disposal systems? </h3>
                <p>
                    The D&eacute;kor is the easiest diaper disposal system to use; emptying the pail
                    and reloading the refills is a snap. It has great styling, and its seals do a great
                    job in keeping odor in the pail and out of your nursery. Also, the D&eacute;kor's
                    efficient use of refills saves you money as the cost per diaper is less than other
                    systems using refills. Finally, while all other diaper pails are useless after you
                    are done with diapers diapers, the D&eacute;kor converts into a trash can that can
                    be used long after diaper days are over.
